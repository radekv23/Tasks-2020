# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Tasks-2020

### Task 1 + extra

**Task explanation:** 
>Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A'] should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook.


### Task 2

**Task explanation:** 
>Write a Python function called dicerolls that simulates
rolling dice. Your function should take two parameters: the number of dice k and
the number of times to roll the dice n. The function should simulate randomly
rolling k dice n times, keeping track of each total face value. It should then return
a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred. So,
calling the function as diceroll(k=2, n=1000) should return a dictionary like:
{2:19,3:50,4:82,5:112,6:135,7:174,8:133,9:114,10:75,11:70,12:36}
You can use any module from the Python standard library you wish and you should
include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook.
